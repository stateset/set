/// @notice Holds buyer funds against a commerce order until the seller proves
///         delivery. If the seller never ships (timeout), the buyer can pull
///         their funds back. This is the "no chargebacks" primitive: once the
///         buyer locks funds the seller can rely on payment, and once goods
///         are delivered (signed off by the buyer's agent or a delivery
///         oracle) the seller can withdraw.
///
/// Lifecycle:
///   LOCKED   ─ funds in escrow, waiting on shipment + delivery
///   DELIVERED ─ delivery proof submitted, in confirmation window
///   RELEASED ─ seller has withdrawn
///   REFUNDED ─ buyer pulled funds back after timeout
///
/// Two trust roles:
///   - operator (typically the StateSet sequencer): can attest delivery on
///     behalf of either party; reduces buyer-seller standoff in the happy
///     path. Demo is permissioned; production would multi-sig this.
///   - buyer + seller: hold their own keys; only they can confirm or refund.
///
/// Out of scope (v1): on-chain dispute arbitration, partial refunds,
/// multi-shipment orders, fee splits. Those layer on top.
