# SetRegistry Bytecode Placeholder
#
# To run integration tests with the real contract:
# 1. cd ../contracts
# 2. forge build
# 3. cp out/SetRegistry.sol/SetRegistry.json ../anchor/tests/fixtures/
# 4. Extract bytecode: jq -r '.bytecode.object' SetRegistry.json > SetRegistry.bin
#
# For now, tests that require this will be skipped.
